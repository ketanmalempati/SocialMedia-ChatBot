# CMPE-252 SocialMedia-ChatBot
One stop solution to all social media

## Motivation
We spend lot of time using social media and potentially waste our time. Even though we might have to search something important we tend to get deviated.  
So this chatbot will send results of only the things you wanted to search.

## How to run
- First install rasa on your system using `pip install rasa`
- Then run `rasa init` to create an initial model
- You can start changing all the files present in the folder
- Run `rasa train` after ever change made before running
- After training run `rasa shell` or `rasa interactive` if you want to run in terminal
- Use `rasa run` if you have connected it to slack and you can start the conversation in slack
## Conversation Flows
### Single Conversations

### Multi-turn Conversations

### Slots Filling Conversation

### Database usage Conversations


## Future Improvements
- Make it more generic
- Add more social media


## Conclusion
It was a fun project to work on.
