# CMPE-252 SocialMedia-ChatBot
One stop solution to all social media.

## Motivation
We spend lot of time using social media and potentially waste our time. Even though we might have to search something important we tend to get deviated. So this chatbot will send results of only the things you wanted to search and not waste much time.  

## How to run
- First install rasa on your system using `pip install rasa`
- Then run `rasa init` to create an initial model
- You can start changing all the files present in the folder
- Run `rasa train` after ever change made before running
- After training run `rasa shell` or `rasa interactive` if you want to run in terminal
- Use `rasa run` if you have connected it to slack and you can start the conversation in slack
- In a new terminal run `rasa run actions` so you can connect to APIs

## Challenges faced
- Named Entity detection was difficult.
- Trying to run actions for the first time was very difficult as I made made mistakes in port number.
- Adding the bot to slack for a little tedious process.
## Conclusion
This project pulls a number of posts of the topics you specify from the social media platforms you choose or all available.
This saves time by avoiding switching from one social media platform to another and becoming distracted in the process.
I learned a lot of things, such as how to build a conservational AI chatbot and how to manage my time.
During class and office hours, I was able to learn a lot from the ISAs.
Overall, it was an enjoyable project to work on.
